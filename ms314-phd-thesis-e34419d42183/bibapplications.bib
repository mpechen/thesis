  abstract = {Online learning algorithms often have to operate in the presence of
	concept drift (i.e., the concepts to be learned can change with time).
	This paper presents a new categorization for concept drift, separating
	drifts according to different criteria into mutually exclusive and
	nonheterogeneous categories. Moreover, although ensembles of learning
	machines have been used to learn in the presence of concept drift,
	there has been no deep study of why they can be helpful for that
	and which of their features can contribute or not for that. As diversity
	is one of these features, we present a diversity analysis in the
	presence of different types of drifts. We show that, before the drift,
	ensembles with less diversity obtain lower test errors. On the other
	hand, it is a good strategy to maintain highly diverse ensembles
	to obtain lower test errors shortly after the drift independent on
	the type of drift, even though high diversity is more important for
	more severe drifts. Longer after the drift, high diversity becomes
	less important. Diversity by itself can help to reduce the initial
	increase in error caused by a drift, but does not provide the faster
	recovery from drifts in long-term.},
