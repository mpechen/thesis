change detection ..

The roots of the change detection problem are in the
field of Statistical process control (SPC) theory
developed in 1920s~\cite{TartakovskySeq} by Walter
Shewhart~\cite{shewhart1931economic}
%
Later it became a part of more general problem -
concept drift detection(Joao Gama).

Change detection is an important problem in the field
of Structural Health Monitoring~\cite{MiaoMultiSensor}

%% The current A350 model has a total of close to 6,000 sensors across the entire plane and generates 2.5 Tb of data per day, while the newer model – expected to take to he skies in 2020 – will capture more than triple that amount.
%% In an industry as driven by technology as the aviation industry, it’s hardly surprising that every element of an aircraft’s performance is being monitored for the potential to make adjustments which could save millions on fuel bills and, more importantly, save lives by improving safety.
%% Engines are equipped with sensors capturing details of every aspect of their operation, meaning that the impact of humidity, air pressure and temperature can be assessed more accurately. It is far cheaper for a company to be able to predict when a part will fail and have a replacement ready, than to wait for it to fail and take the equipment offline until repairs can be completed.

Sensor generated data are ubiquitous.
In the aviation industry Airbus A350 is equipped with 6000 sensors across the
entire plane and generates 2.5Tb of data per day.
Newer model Airbus A380 will be equipped with 10.000 sensors in each wing.  
Sensor recordings allow increase operational efficiency 

Sensors are devices measuring physical properties evolving over time.

Examples of the sources of the sensor generated data
\begin{itemize}
	\item Airplanes
	\item ISP providers
	\item Car engines
    \item biomedical applications: to monitor pulse rate, respiration in order to improve sleep quality 
    \item EEG monitoring 
    \item Unusual sequences of credit card transactions (NN lec.)
    \item Unusual pattern of sensor readings in a nuclear power plant (NN lec.)
