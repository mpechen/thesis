	time series prediction. The cumulative sum of square (CUSUMS) statistic
	proposed by Brown et al (1975) has been developed as a general method
	for detecting a structural break. To better utilize this method,
	this paper analyses the operating conditions of the centered version
	of CUSUMS using three variables: the percentage of variance change,
	the post-break data size and the pre-break data size. In traditional
	approach of the centered CUSUMS, all available data are used for
	the break detection. Our analysis reveals that one can improve the
	accuracy of the break detection by either reducing the post-break
	data size or increasing pre-break data size. Based on our analysis,
	we propose a modified test statistic. The evidence shows that the
	modified statistic significantly improves the chance of detecting
	the structural breaks.},
