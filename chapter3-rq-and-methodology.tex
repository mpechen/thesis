\chapter{Research questions and Methodology}
% Methodology:
% - How do we answer RQs: simulation, controlled experiments, etc.
In this work we concentrate on the Change detection control unit (Figure~\ref{fig:fig3_gama_survey_cd}) which makes a decision when to retrain the model.
Implementation is done in a form of change detection algorithm.

Concept drifts are usually assumed to be not predictable.
We consider the case when they are predictable.

\begin{itemize}
  \item [i)] Model
  \item [ii)] Model with DDM
  \item [iii)] Model with DDM and embedded Pccf
\end{itemize}

Is it so that iii) is better than ii) and ii) is better than i) under certain assumptions?
If assumptions are wrong then even ii) is not better than i)~\cite{SouzaRMB20}.

In~\cite{XXX} we demonstrated how FA rate and detection delays can be lowered for changedetection problem.
It can be used for concept drift handling in on-line learning under certain assumptions.


\section{Formalization of recurrent change detection}
% Formalization of recurrent change detection
% Nikolai: likely current 2.9 (Recurrency) and some 2.10 (Pccf) goes here
\input{sections_recurrency_and_pccf}


\section{Research questions}
% Nikolai: - Questions about ROI and PCCF
% Nikolai: - Questions about integration with detectors
% Nikolai: - Questions about impact of better detection of recurrent changes on model adaptation / adaptive learning
% Nikolai: - From the SDM, BLPA and the submitted journal paper please extract /formulate the main research questions they answer and add them here to Section 3.2
\begin{itemize}
    \item a

\section{Research methodology}
%Nikolai:  Here, I think you can use a high-level umbrella or Nunamaker et al. 
%Nikolai:  See e.g. Figure 14 and brief discussion around it in my thesis at p.49  https://jyx.jyu.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/13253/1/9513922715.pdf
%Nikolai:  You can adapt the figure to your needs. I.e. four ovals become:
%Nikolai:  Theory building: PCCF; (conceptualization, formalization, theorem proving
%Nikolai:  Artifact development: Recurrent change detection technique development
%Nikolai:  Experimentation with benchmark datasets: (recurrent) change detection performance; effect of (recurrent) change detection on predictive modeling
%Nikolai:  
%Nikolai:  Simulation with synthetic data: (recurrent) change detection performance
%Nikolai:  Please put as much info into Chapter 3 as you can during tomorrow. F
