\chapter{Contexts}
\begin{definition}
Context is an additional information which describes current situation and helps improve performance of the predictive or decision making model.

%% PGM lectures
Let's consider a robot whose state is a location denote as $L^{t+1}$.
Under Markovian assumption $L^{t+1} \perp L^{t-1} | L^{t}$.
If we enrich the state notion by the velocity the prediction will be more accurate.
In that case velocity is a contextual variable.
However we may include into the state description more recent locations and calculate velocity using the series of the most recent locations (feature extraction).

% HMM
Contextual information may be viewed as latent unobserved variable  as in HMM model~\cite{RabinerHMM}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$ distinct states $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^N$
    \item The actual state at time $t$ is $q_t$.
    \item Markov property $P(q_t=S_j|q_{t-1}=S_i, q_{t-2}=S_k, \dots) = P(q_t=S_j|q_{t-1}=S_i)$

    \item Transition probabilities $a_{ij} = P(q_t = S_j \: | \: q_{t-1} = S_i), \: a_{ij}>0, \: \sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij} = 1$
