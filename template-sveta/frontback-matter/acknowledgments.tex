I am greatly indebted to my supervisors Prof. Pekka Neittaanm\"aki and Prof. 
Sergey Repin for their excellent supervision, which started in 2011 during my Master 
thesis, for fruitful scientific discussions with them, for their ongoing support 
to my attempts to make scientific contributions, and for their 
constant mentoring outside of scientific work. 

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
I would like to express my appreciation and admiration to the reviewers 
Prof. Dr. Roland Glowinski and Prof. Dr. Ulrich Langer
for their valuable comments and 
the significant improvement of the quality of my thesis during the 
review process.

I am deeply grateful to all the local and international members of our research 
group `Reliable Methods for Computer Simulation' for interesting discussions we had 
about scientific and non-scientific matters. I want to especially thank Dr. Olli 
Mali and Dr. Immanuel Anjam for their help and guidance during my PhD studies and 
detailed corrections for the thesis. My deep appreciation also goes to Dr. Monika 
Wolfmayr for thorough proof-reading and revision of this work.

My kind acknowledgments go the GETA Postgraduate School, COMAS \linebreak
Graduate School,  
Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation, and Finnish Academy of Science and Letters 
Foundation for funding my PhD research. I also thank the Department of Mathematical 
Informational Technology and its head Prof. Tuomo Rossi for financial support 
to allow me to participate in several conferences and make research visits during 
my studies.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
Lastly, I thank my family for their love and support despite the distance between us, 
to my boyfriend Philipp, who significantly contributed to this journey by dragging 
me away from work every so often, showed me care and encouragement, and yet 
was tolerant to my endless hours in the office, and last but not the least 
my dearest friends scattered around many countries for all the wonderful 
experiences shared throughout the past years.

I dedicate this work to the loving memory of my mother Elena (1966--2008).
