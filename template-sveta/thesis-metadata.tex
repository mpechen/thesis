\abstract{This work is devoted to fully reliable a posteriori error analysis for a 
class of evolutionary problems and some questions emerging in relation to it. 
The first articles in this collection are concerned with theoretical 
and numerical analysis, efficient and robust implementation of the 
functional type a posteriori error estimates and indicators for the nonlinear Cauchy 
problem, and time-dependent reaction-diffusion 
initial-boundary value problems of parabolic type. The last part of the study is 
dedicated to computable and sharp upper bounds of constants in Poincar\'{e}-type 
inequalities for functions with zero mean on the boundary (or a measurable part of it) 
on non-degenerate triangles and tetrahedrons. These sharp upper bounds are crucial for 
quantitative analysis of problems generated by differential equations, where 
numerical approximations are typically constructed with the help of simplicial 
meshes and become particularly useful in implementation of the functional error 
majorants applied for the problems with a decomposed domain.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

The error estimates presented in this thesis are explicitly computable and guaranteed. 
The two-sided functional type error bounds hold for all conforming approximations,
do not depend on any mesh discretization parameters, 
and only contain global and local constants in Poincar\'{e} inequalities. 
Extensive numerical 
experiments, performed alongside with theoretical findings, provide results, which 
confirm the efficiency and reliability of the error estimates and robustness of 
the indicators they comprise. For numerical implementation we use {\rm MATLAB} and  
{\rm The FEniCS Project} (with Python).
