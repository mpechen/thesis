Comments for the Author:

Reviewer #2: The authors proposed an approach for improving change detection performance of the CuSum algorithm by identification of a prediction interval for case where changes (concept drifts) are predictable. They claim that the change detection can be improved in comparison to the static settings of Cusum if the average run length corresponding to the dynamic threshold value is smaller than the width of prediction interval. Opposite to the other research efforts that are based on online change detection mechanisms for handling concept drift they claim that there are various application settings in which concept drifts are expected to reoccur with a pattern and try to show that by experiments on artificially generated data.

They identified three main contributions of their work:
Experimental demonstration that the prediction intervals capturing change points locations can decrease the detection delay by lowering detection threshold without increasing false alarm rate.
They explain theoretically the decrease of the detection delay without increasing the FA rate.
Concise description of the Pccf algorithm.

The paper is interesting and well written. The authors give a good overview of the related work. They clearly presented the novelty and the past research efforts and the application of pccf algorithm for improving the performance of the Cusum approach. They clearly stated that the applicability of this approach is limited and it is based on the assumption that the concept drifts are expected to reoccur with some pattern (otherwise the applicability of the proposed approach is not feasible). They presented the advantages of the proposed approach on an artificially generated dataset. But, I expect this to be showed on larger range of datasets and experiments. Introducing some real case scenarios (real world dataset) as part of this paper will be very beneficial. Some efforts on this point are made using the temperature dataset, but I think that it should be covered better. Taking into account that the pccf algorithm is already proposed by the authors in their previous work, my
opinion is that the contribution should be larger to accept the paper. I suggest more extensive experiments to prove the hypothesis and more extensive research about the problems that has reoccurring concept drifts.


Reviewer #3: Please see my formal report, if the PDF file with it is available. In plain text:

Referee report on the article
"Improving CUSUM performance in presence of prediction intervals"

The article focuses on the change-point detection methods that take into account a
certain prior information about the location of change points. The authors propose the
PCCF algorithm from their earlier work and show that because of this additional data,
both the mean detection delay and the rate of false alarms can be simultaneously reduced.
In my evaluation, the paper is not ready for publication for the following reasons:
1. First, it uses a non-Bayesian (frequentist) CUSUM method for the situation that
seems to perfectly align with Bayesian change-point detection because of the use
of a prior information about the location of change-points. The optimal detection
procedure in this case should be the Bayesian algorithm (for example, [2],[6] for
classical off-line and [1], [4], [5], and of course, chapter 7 of [7], for more recent
sequential procedures). It is not clear why the authors don't use Bayesian procedures
to solve Bayesian problems.
2. Second, the prior information in the form of prior probabilities (4)-(5) is only used to
determine the intervals where changes may occur. Unlike Bayesian procedures, the
proposed algorithm does not utilize the rest of the prior, for example, the more likely
and the less likely locations of change-points. Also, by ignoring the intervals where
changes are not likely, the authors increase the probability of missing a change-point
without detecting it.
3. Third, for all practical purposes, too much seems to be assumed. That is, the
proposed algorithm assumes a whole matrix of estimated change-point probabilities.
A lot of data needs to be observed and processed, and many change-points have to
be detected very accurately, in order to have good estimates of such a probability
matrix. The estimation error in thee probabilities does not seem to be taken into
account in the analysis of the detection delays and false alarm rates.
4. And lastly, if we assume such an accurate estimation of the prior distribution of
change-points, improved performance under all this additional information is not
a major accomplishment. Of course, the more we know the better our statistical
analysis should be.
The CUSUM algorithm defined by (2) only targets changes in the mean. It should be
clarified in the article that it is focusing on these changes only (as opposed to changes in
variance and other changes in distribution).
The characterization of the CUSUM statistic as a random walk is wrong. CUSUM is
not a random walk because of the maximum in equation (2). It is correct to say that it
is a random walk with an absorbing screen (or barrier) at 0.
The terms "static" and "dynamic" detectors are misleading. There are "retrospective"
or "off-line" and "sequential" or "on-line" change-point detection procedures, but the
authors mean a different situation. The article is focused on the prior information about
intervals where changes can occur. Perhaps, call them "informed" methods, in view of
additional information?
A Normal distribution between change-points is an unfortunate choice. Naturally,
interarrival times should rather be modeled by a positive random variable such as Expo-
nential, Gamma, or Weibull. The authors' remark to use a Normal distribution with a
sufficiently small  is an attempt to fix this, but the requirement of a small  is a huge lim-
itation saying essentially that a lot is known a'priori about the location of change-points.
Also, no  will guarantee that a Normal variable is positive. Finally in this regard, given
the Normal distribution, one does not need Chebychev's inequality in (6) to estimate the
probability that is known exactly from the Normal distribution.
Derivation (7)-(10) is not needed. The distribution of a sum of Normal random vari-
ables is textbook common knowledge.
Minor suggestions and corrections:
* p.2, line 12... In sequential analysis, ARL typically refers to both the mean delay
and the mean time between false alarms, depending on the true parameter. That's
why it's usually written as ARL(0) or ARL(1). Perhaps, it can be clarified in the
article by just replacing "which is also referred as" with "which are also referred to
as".
* p.2, line 15... Insert a comma after "detector".
* p.2, line 24... "We refer to this type"
* Next line... "The first research question..."
* p.2 and later, in multiple places... please correct the reference to [3]. It should be
Basseville and Nikiforov (1993) instead of Basseville Michelle et al, because Michelle
is the first name of Basseville.
* p.3, line 5... The "Bayesian learn predict adjust method" should better be called
the "Bayesian learn-predict-adjust method" or the "Bayesian learning, prediction,
and adjustment method", to be grammatically correct.
* p.3, line 20... abbreviation ROI should be explained. It would also be recommended
to write abbreviations DDM and EDDM in he top of p.4 explicitly.
* p.4, line 6... delete an extra "and"
* p.5, lines 7-8... "As an input, CuSum detector receives a time series of observations
[1], usually taken at constant sampling rate,"
* p.5, bottom line... "ARL refers to the FA rate before the change". This is not
correct. In the literature, the FA rate is the reciprocal of the expected time (ARL)
until the false alarm. That is, E(td | tc = 1) is the expected time until FA; then
FA rate = 1/E(td | tc = 1)
* p.7, line 40... "Plots ... illustrate" (instead of "illustrates")
There are many errors in the grammar and style throughout the manuscript, most
commonly, missed commas and prepositions. I only listed a few suggestions above, and
the list is certainly incomplete. If the authors decide to revise and resubmit their paper,
I would recommend to use services of a professional proofreader.
