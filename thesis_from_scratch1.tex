\title{Predictive analytics with online change detection in data streams}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle
  In supervised learning settings ML model is trained on historical data and the applied to unseen data often in streaming settings.
  But concept drift (CD) can happen and trained model is not relevant anymore.
  In order to detect CD change detectors are used to monitor changes in models performance metrics on-line. 
  Here is an example how detector works:
  Here is an example of CD: SINE1
  Here is an example of adaptive learning with detector and without:
  It can be seen that with detector performance is better and with recurrent detector it is even more better.
