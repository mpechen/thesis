% Methodology:
% - How do we answer RQs: simulation, controlled experiments, etc.
\begin{itemize}
  \item [i)] Model
  \item [ii)] Model with DDM
  \item [iii)] Model with DDM and embedded Pccf
\end{itemize}

Is it so that iii) is better than ii) and ii) is better than i) under certain assumptions?
If assumptions are wrong then even ii) is not better than i)~\cite{SouzaRMB20}.

In ~\cite{XXX} we demonstrated hhow FA arte and detection delays can be lowered for changedetection problem.
It can be used for concept drift handling in on-line learning under certain assumptions.
