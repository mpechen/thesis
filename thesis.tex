\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Relation between concept drift in multidimensional data streams and change detection in time series}\
%\chapter{Concept drift}
\textit{Concept drift}~\cite{schlimmer1986incremental,gama2014survey}  is a phenomenon when relation between the input data and the target variable changes over time~\cite{gama2014survey}.
\textit{Adaptive learning} refers to updating model online to react to concept drifts~\cite{gama2014survey}.

Machine Learning models learn the relation between input data $X$ and target variable $y$ by approximating a joint distribution $P(X,y)$. 
Model performance degrades when learned underlying data distribution changes.
Therefore concept drift can be detected by monitoring change points in model's output performance statistics.

Concept drift and change detection problem.
Concept drift can be reduced to change detection in univariate time series?




\begin{itemize}
  \item Change detection:~\cite{basseville1993detection}

  \item Sequential change detection problem is a well studied problem, see for example in~\cite{tartakovsky2014sequential}, ~\cite{plasse2021streaming}. 

  \item Optimality of the change detection procedure was investigated in~\cite{Page1954},~\cite{Shiryaev2010,Shiryaev1961,Shiryaev1963}.
  Asymptotic and nonasymptotic optimality of cumulative sum algorithms was provedin~\cite{lorden1971procedures},~\cite{moustakides1986optimal},~\cite{moustakides2004optimality},~\cite{ritov1990decision}. In~\cite{Shiryaev1963,shiryaev2007optimal} the change point is modelled as a random variable with a known geometric distribution~\cite{veeravalli2014quickest} and optimal algorithm minimizing the average detection delay given constraint on the probability of false alarm is proposed. In our work we minimize the detection delay given a constraint on the maximum delay imposed by the prediction interval width. In~\cite{lorden1971procedures} asymptotic optimality of Cusum~\cite{Page1954} is proved according to the minimax criterion for delay with the mean time between false alarms going to infinity.
