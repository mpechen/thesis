\section{Concept drift and change detection in time series problems}
%===============================================================================%
Concept drift~\cite{schlimmer1986incremental,gama2014survey} is a
phenomenon when relation between the input data and the target variable changes
over time~\cite{gama2014survey}.
Adaptive learning refers to updating model online to react to concept
drifts~\cite{gama2014survey}.
%===============================================================================%
Machine Learning models learn the relation between input data $X$ and target
variable $y$ by approximating a joint distribution $P(X,y)$.  Model performance
degrades when learned underlying data distribution changes.  Therefore concept
drift can be detected by monitoring change points in model's output performance
statistics.
%===============================================================================%
On-line change detection in time series data is an old practical problem with
the roots in the problem of statistical quality
control~\cite{basseville1993detection}, ~\cite{NISTbook}.  Walter A. Shewhart
invented control charts in 1924 while working on the problem of statistical
quality control to improve reliability of telephone transmission systems.
%===============================================================================%
Quality control
$X$ is a set of sensor readings and $y=good$ is a quality of the produced item.
%===============================================================================%
Offline and online.
In offline learning all training data is available during training.
In online learning the data is processed sequentially from data streams.
Model is being updated as more data arrives.
Data evolve over time in dynamically changing environments.

Concept drift and change detection problem.
Concept drift can be reduced to change detection in univariate time series?


\begin{itemize}
  \item Change detection:~\cite{basseville1993detection}

  \item Sequential change detection problem is a well studied problem, see for example in~\cite{tartakovsky2014sequential}, ~\cite{plasse2021streaming}. 

  \item Optimality of the change detection procedure was investigated in~\cite{Page1954},~\cite{Shiryaev2010,Shiryaev1961,Shiryaev1963}.
  Asymptotic and nonasymptotic optimality of cumulative sum algorithms was provedin~\cite{lorden1971procedures},~\cite{moustakides1986optimal},~\cite{moustakides2004optimality},~\cite{ritov1990decision}. In~\cite{Shiryaev1963,shiryaev2007optimal} the change point is modelled as a random variable with a known geometric distribution~\cite{veeravalli2014quickest} and optimal algorithm minimizing the average detection delay given constraint on the probability of false alarm is proposed. In our work we minimize the detection delay given a constraint on the maximum delay imposed by the prediction interval width. In~\cite{lorden1971procedures} asymptotic optimality of Cusum~\cite{Page1954} is proved according to the minimax criterion for delay with the mean time between false alarms going to infinity.
