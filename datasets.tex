\section{Datasets}

In papers~\cite{MaslovSDM2016, MaslovIJCNN2017} we performed experiments experiments with artificially generated and with real datasets.

In the paper~\cite{MaslovSDM2016} we did experiments with two real datasets - with i) the boiler dataset containing sensor readings measuring recurrent refuelling behavior and ii) Internet traffic dataset\footnote{\url{https://datamarket.com/data/list/?q=internet+traffic+data+price\%3Afree}} containing aggregated internet traffic data from Internet Service Provider in the UK academic network backbone. The data series is illustrate in Figure~\ref{fig:trafficdata}.

In the paper~\cite{MaslovIJCNN2017} we used the Human activity data set~\cite{reyes2016transition} which contains sensor measurements from people performed 6 types of activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs and walking
upstairs).

In the Journal version paper (cite) we did experiments with the time series of temperature measurements collected from the sensor installed in the home office environment.
