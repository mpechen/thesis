\chapter{Introduction}

Change point detection is an important practical problem across many domains and applications.
And it is tightly connected to the Concept drift (CD) problem in machine learning area.
Change point detection is mainly for time series data (one- or multi-dimensional).
While CD is more general problem to detect changes in high-dimensional data streams feeded into ML predictive models.


% 1. Motivation

In batch, or, offline training settings, models are trained using a fixed training data set and then used to make predictions on incoming data. 
However, streaming, or, on-line settings, are more prevalent in real world applications. 
In both cases a concept drift can happen and the model performance can drop. 
In order to detect concept drifts, change detectors are used to monitor changes in models performance metrics on-line~\cite{gama2004learning}. 
Once change is alarmed the model can be re-trained using the most relevant data between last change and current time moment.
In this scenario model will be trained using only most recent relevant data batch and will have a better performance than sliding window or growing window updated model.
We propose to use recurrency information to skip false alarms and possibly detect changes with smaller delays.

% 2. Research goals / questions
Our research goal is to develop a mathematical model and its software implementation for improving change detection performance in case if CD or change event is predictable with the aim to i) reduce FA rate and ii) decrease the detection delay. 

% 3. Contributions 

The core is articles 1), 2) and 3)

% All articles and which we include
In the paper 1) we introduced Pccf and integrated it with the naive threshold based detector.
In the paper 2) we address uncertainty in Pccf parameters estimation and integrate Pccf with the Bayesian detector.
In 3) we improve Pccf definition and calculation procedure and integrate it with the Cusum detector, address detection delay decrease and particular statistical properties of the Cusum output statistic.
